This is a personal website to promote my services as an ESL instructor.

## Milestone 1
Your purpose, audience, and goals are well defined. This will help you guide you through Milestone 2a when it comes to thinking of you are going to design the site. Persona is very detailed and descriptive which will also help you in the upcoming design phase.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great!

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.


## Milestone 2a Feedback
Good work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and defined. This will provide you with a good guide for your development phase ahead.

Be careful with your staggered layout on mobile. You might want to stack these items on the smallest screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably read the text - the horizontal space might get too narrow, so stagger only on screen sizes that can accommodate it well.

Additional recommendations:

Google Fonts - has ~1000 free fonts & easy to integrate https://fonts.google.com/

FontAwesome - quality library with free iconography for use.

You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
